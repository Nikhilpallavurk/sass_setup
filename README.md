# SASS Integration Example

This project demonstrates how to integrate SASS (SCSS) with an HTML file. The SASS code is compiled into CSS, which is then linked to the HTML file.

## Project Structure
```

.
├── index.html
├── styles.scss
└── styles.css (generated)

````

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the compiled CSS.
- `styles.scss`: The SASS/SCSS file where styles are written.
- `styles.css`: The compiled CSS file generated from `styles.scss`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
````

### 2. Install SASS

If you don’t have SASS installed, you can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g sass
```

### 3. Compile SASS to CSS

Compile the `styles.scss` file to `styles.css` using the following command:

```bash
sass sass/index.scss styles.css
```

This will generate a `styles.css` file in the same directory.

### 4. Open the HTML File

You can now open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the styles applied:

```bash
open index.html
```

### 5. Watch for Changes (Optional)

If you’re actively working on the SASS file, you can use SASS to watch for changes and automatically compile to CSS:

```bash
sass --watch styles.scss:styles.css
```

This command will watch the `styles.scss` file and update `styles.css` whenever you save changes.
